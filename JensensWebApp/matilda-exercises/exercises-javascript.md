Exercises JavaSript
==============

***Exercise One:***

Design a simple program that takes in a number (n) from the user
and outputs the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, but only including
those numbers that are either multiples of 3 or 5.

Assume the user passed the number ‘10’ in the function, this means
you will have to add the numbers 3, 5, 6, 9 and 10 together since
those are the numbers that has a zero remainder when divided with
either of those numbers(3,5) and print out the result.

***Exercise Two*:**

Write a program that prints the lyrics of the song "99 Bottles of Beer on the
Wall". The song goes like this:

“””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

“”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

The song continues, with 1 less bottle each time, until there are no more
bottles left.
After the loop has finished (i.e., when there are no more bottles left), the final
lines of the song are logged to the console.

***Exercise Three:***

Create a function that takes a number as an argument and calculates the
factorial of the number using recursion. The factorial of a number is the
product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number.
Factorial of 5 in a function = 5! Which is 1*2*3*4*5
