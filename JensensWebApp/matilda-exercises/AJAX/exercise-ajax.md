Exercises JSOn
==============

Write JavaScript code to fetch a local text file named "data.txt" using AJAX (you may use 
XMLHttpRequest). When the data is loaded, log it to the console.  
 
Use https://glitch.com/ to run your code since it is very cumbersome to use the local hosting 
environment for this purpose alone.  
 
Create a txt file and upload it to the Glitch Website in your project then inside the index.html 
file put your JavaScript file that uses AJAX(XMLHttpRequest).
