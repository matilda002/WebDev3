Exercises JavaScript
==============

### Exercise One: Values, Types, Operators

Design a simple program that takes in a number (n) from the user
and outputs the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, but only including
those numbers that are either multiples of 3 or 5.

Assume the user passed the number ‘10’ in the function, this means
you will have to add the numbers 3, 5, 6, 9 and 10 together since
those are the numbers that has a zero remainder when divided with
either of those numbers(3,5) and print out the result.

### Exercise Two: Program Structures

Write a program that prints the lyrics of the song "99 Bottles of Beer on the
Wall". The song goes like this:

“””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

“”””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””””

The song continues, with 1 less bottle each time, until there are no more
bottles left. After the loop has finished (i.e., when there are no more bottles left), 
the final lines of the song are logged to the console.

### Exercise Three: Functions

Create a function that takes a number as an argument and calculates the
factorial of the number using recursion. The factorial of a number is the
product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number.
Factorial of 5 in a function = 5! Which is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5

### Exercise Four: Data Structures Object and Arrays

Create a function named findPet that takes in an array of pet objects and a pet
name as parameters. Each pet object has properties name and type. The
function should return the type of the pet whose name was passed in. If the
pet name does not ex ist in the list, return "Pet not found".

### Exercise Five: Higher Order Functions
Write a higher order function named calculate that takes two numbers and a
callback function as arguments. The callback function should perform an
operation on the two numbers (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
d ivision). Demonstrate usage of calculate with different operations.

### Exercise Six: Objects
Create a class named Car that has properties make, model, and year. The class
should also have a method named getCarInfo that returns a string with all of
the car's information. Demonstrate creating an instance of the class and calling 
the getCarInfo method.

### Exercise Seven DOM: Manipulation
Create an HTML page with a button and an empty paragraph. Write JavaScript
to attach an event listener to the button so that, when the button is clicked,
it updates the paragraph text with the number of times the button has been clicked.

### Exercise Eight: Handling Events
Create an HTML page with three coloured div elements (red, green, blue) and a
paragraph. When a div is clicked, the text within the paragraph should update
to display which colour was clicked.
